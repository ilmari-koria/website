This is just here to run (om-to-xml).

Emacs compiled via:
,----
| ./autogen.sh
| ./configure --prefix=/home/ilmari/my-files/blog/website/emacs/emacs --bindir=/home/ilmari/my-files/blog/website/emacs/bin --with-x-toolkit=no --with-xpm=no --with-jpeg=no --with-png=no --with-gif=no --with-tiff=no
| make
| make install

Re- the sigsegv issue in Debian, use the updated code in e.g. Emacs
30.1:
,----
|  #if defined HAVE_STACK_OVERFLOW_HANDLING && !defined WINDOWSNT
|  
|  /* Alternate stack used by SIGSEGV handler below.  */
|  
|  /* Storage for the alternate signal stack.
|     64 KiB is not too large for Emacs, and is large enough
|     for all known platforms.  Smaller sizes may run into trouble.
|     For example, libsigsegv 2.6 through 2.8 have a bug where some
|     architectures use more than the Linux default of an 8 KiB alternate
|     stack when deciding if a fault was caused by stack overflow.  */
|  static max_align_t sigsegv_stack[(64 * 1024
|  				  + sizeof (max_align_t) - 1)
|  				 / sizeof (max_align_t)];
